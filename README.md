# sqlalchemy-challenge: Climate in Honolulu, Hawaii

## Resource

* hawaii.sqlite

## Analysis

### 1. Climate Analysis and Exploration

* Vacation range is approximately 3-15 days

#### Precipitation Analysis

* The precipitation data for the last 12 months

#### Station Analysis

* Total number of stations

* The most active stations

* The temperature for the last 12 months of the stations (TOBS)

### 2. Climate App

* /api/v1.0/precipitation

* /api/v1.0/stations

* /api/v1.0/tobs

* /api/v1.0/<start> and /api/v1.0/<start>/<end>
  

### 3. Temperature Analysis I

* Is there a meaningful difference between the temperature in, for example, June and December?

### 4. Temperature Analysis II

* Calculate the min, avg, and max temperatures for your trip using the matching dates from the previous year (i.e., use "2017-01-01" if your trip start date was "2018-01-01")

### 5. Daily Rainfall Average

* Calculate the rainfall per weather station using the previous year's matching dates.

* Calculate the daily normals. Normals are the averages for the min, avg, and max temperatures.
